# ExtensionTutorialFix
A fix for the Chrome Browser's Getting Started Broken Tutorial


Chrome Browser Extension tutorial: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

The code provided for download does not work and is listed as an issue here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=827804

Popup.html should not exist. popup.js should also be deleted with the exception of a few lines, which are transfered to options.js.

The Repo contains my working version of the code. Please raise an issue if you spot something I have missed.
